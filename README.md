## 💡 About Me

I'm a passionate and curious **Data Science and AI enthusiast** with a strong foundation in software engineering and a growing portfolio of hands-on projects. My mission is to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights, using code and creativity to solve real-world problems.

I'm a lifelong learner who thrives on challenges, innovation, and continuous growth. Whether it’s building ML models, crafting user-centric software, or automating workflows, I’m always eager to push boundaries and collaborate with purpose-driven teams.

> *"Stay hungry, stay foolish."* – Steve Jobs  
These words define my approach to life, learning, and technology. I believe in staying curious, embracing discomfort, and building solutions that make an impact.
